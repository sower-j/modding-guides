# Mod Organizer 2 Sorting Crash Course

The goal of this document is to get you familiarized with the basics of how to sort mods and plugins with MO2. This will not be an in-depth guide for everything MO2. If you would like to see more about mod naming schemes, setting up separators, etc. have a look at my General MO2 Guide (coming soon).

  - Note: MO2 does not handle mods that need to be in a game's base folder (where the EXE is located). If you would like to have MO2 handle mods like that I recommend using [Kezyma's Root Builder](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31720). I have a [guide for installing and using](./mo2-rootbuilder.md) it if you have a hard time following his instructions.

  ## MO2's Interface

  There are two panes presented in MO2. The left is the `mods` pane, and is connected to `modlist.txt` which is generated by MO2. The right is the `loadorder` pane, and is connected to `loadorder.txt` which is also generated by MO2.sed               
  
  These lists can be found in the profile folder. It is a good idea to provide both of these files when asking for help with modding
